Need to wrap adc-doc-parser.rb in a shell script that cleans up the html

Functions and Constants should be treated separately?




not all relevant files end with Reference.html

e.g.

Contents/Resources/Documents/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITextViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/UITextViewDelegate.html

bin/parse < 4_2/Contents/Resources/Documents/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/UIImagePickerController/UIImagePickerController.html

This HTML file parses correctly. It needs to be picked up by the script that 
generates the list of documentation files to feed into the parser tool.


Fields 

cocoa_class
superclasses (array)
protocols
framework
availability (of class)
companion_guides
related_sample_code
overview

methods:
name # could be instanceMethod classMethod property?
type
declaration
parameters (array) # can be text
return_value
abstract
discussion
taskgroup <- could be typedef enum
availability
seealso
related_sample_code

Question: should I put constants and Classes in this same table?

- then cocoa_class => name
- superclasses could also encompass typedef or constants group
- taskgroup could serve 
- declared_in is also useful

- reuse: decaration, availability, related_sample_code

At what point does producing intermediate YAML make things more
complicated than inserting directly into 

Maybe I should make the parser a simple dispatch

Change `cocoa_class` to `name` and use for class, method, property,
functions, and constants

It may be easier to test and scan the program by inserting records
directly into the database. Use sequel.

Maybe instead of putting this in all in a database, the database should
just be an index to lines in a textfile, like ctags.

Then I just have a make a set of text files for each page in the doc of
functions, etc.

seealso and related code can go into discussion




This is also a path to be aware of

4_2/Contents/Resources/Documents/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Miscellaneous/Foundation_DataTypes/Reference/reference.html



bin/parse < 4_2/Contents/Resources/Documents/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html


Should deal with datatypes and constants in the same table.

CFStream - contains functions, datatypes and constants on the same page!



api special considerations


tight jump struct
tight jump typeDef

both are DataTypes
